# pricingService
Project for Pricing Service Of an Online Course Portal

Presumption: there is discount service, which will take courseId,courseFeeAmount and CouponCode and gives the discount amount.
I am mocking the discount service with 5 % flat discount.


2: Assumption : Coversion rate is hardcoded in enum as per country,
same can be fetched from third party API at runtime.
